# Project Instructions
Perform exploratory data analysis on the ```netflix_data.csv``` data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.
* What was the most frequent **movie** duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called ```duration``` (use 1990 as the decade's start year).
  
* A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of **short action movies** released in the 1990s and save this integer as ```short_movie_count```.

### Expected Output:
* ```duration``` = 102
* ```short_movie_count``` = 7
